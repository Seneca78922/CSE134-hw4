Changes to site:
In the resume tab (resume.html) I embedded a real pdf of my resume (was empty before).

In the Projects tab (Projects.html), I included two linked descriptions of real project. The link is for private github repos though. 


3rd party script added: 

google analytics: Added the script in every html page of my website so I can track users visiting (mostly interested in page views and outbound clicks to get a sense of people visiting my github and/or projects).
